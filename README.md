# Outpainting Server

> This is used to serve multiple exports generated by the [Outpainting](https://github.com/SimonGuethler/outpainting)
> Project.
>
> It serves the [Outpainting App](https://github.com/SimonGuethler/outpainting-app).

# Usage

Put all the exports in separate folders in the ``public`` folder.

It should look like:

```
.
└── public
    ├── export1
    ├── export2
    ├── ...
```

Each of those folders should contain all .webp images and the sqlite.db file.

## Local

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Docker

Simply bind the public ``folder`` into the container ``/app/public`` and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
